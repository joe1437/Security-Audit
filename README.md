<h1>Conducting a security audit</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
For this project, I will be conducting a security audit for a fictional company called Botium Toys
<br />

<h2>Scenario </h2>

- Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location. However, its online presence has grown, attracting customers    in the U.S. and abroad. Their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

- The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure  business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

- The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture. The IT manager wants to use the audit findings as evidence to obtain approval to expand his department.

 <h1>Audit results</h1>
 <h3> Audit scope </h3>
 
Botium Toys internal IT audit will assess the following:
- •	Current user permissions set in the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, security information and event management (SIEM) tool.
- •	Current implemented controls in the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
- •	Current procedures and protocols set for the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewall, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
- •	Ensure current user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols in place align with necessary compliance requirements.
- •	Ensure current technology is accounted for. Both hardware and system access.



<h3> Audit goals </h3>

The goals for Botium Toys’ internal IT audit are:
- •	To adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) 
- •	Establish a better process for their systems to ensure they are compliant 
- •	Fortify system controls
- •	Implement the concept of least permissions when it comes to user credential management 
- •	Establish their policies and procedures, which includes their playbooks 
- •	Ensure they are meeting compliance requirements

<h3> Risk assessment </h3>

Assets managed by the IT Department include: 
- •	On-premises equipment for in-office business needs  
- •	Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc.
- •	Management of systems, software, and services: accounting, telecommunication, database, security, ecommerce, and inventory management
- •	Internet access
- •	Internal network
- •	Vendor access management
- •	Data center hosting services  
- •	Data retention and storage
- •	Badge readers
- •	Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human monitoring 

Risk description:
- Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have the proper controls in place and may not be compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards. 

Control best practices:
- The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify. Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to managing assets. Additionally, they will need to determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.

Risk score:
- On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of controls and adherence to necessary compliance regulations and standards.

Additional comments:
- The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium, because the IT department does not know which assets would be lost. The likelihood of a lost asset or fines from governing bodies is high because Botium Toys does not have all of the necessary controls in place and is not adhering to required regulations and standards related to keeping customer data private.


<h3> Critical findings (must be addressed immediately)</h3>

Lack of compliance with GDPR, PCI DSS, and Systems and Organization Controls, new policies required.

Controls that should be implemented immediately:

- •	Least Privilege: Preventative; reduces risk by making sure vendors and non-authorized staff only have access to the assets/data they need to do their jobs
- •	Access control policies: Preventative; increase confidentiality and integrity of data
- •	Account management policies: Preventative; reduce attack surface and limit overall impact from disgruntled/former employees
- •	Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Detective; allows IT team to identify possible intrusions (e.g., anomalous traffic) quickly
- •	Separation of duties: Preventative; ensure no one has so much access that they can abuse the system for personal gain
- •	Locking cabinets (for network gear): Preventative; increase integrity by preventing unauthorized personnel/individuals from physically accessing/modifying network infrastructure gear
- •	Locks: Preventative; physical and digital assets are more secure
- •	Disaster recovery plans: Corrective; business continuity to ensure systems are able to run in the event of an incident/there is limited to no loss of productivity downtime/impact to system components, including: computer room environment (air conditioning, power supply, etc.); hardware (servers, employee equipment); connectivity (internal network, wireless); applications (email, electronic data); data and restoration
- •	Password policies: Preventative; establish password strength rules to improve security/reduce likelihood of account compromise through brute force or dictionary attack - - techniques
- •	Encryption: Deterrent; makes confidential information/data more secure (e.g., website payment transactions)
- •	Backups: Corrective; supports ongoing productivity in the case of an event; aligns to the disaster recovery plan
- •	Password management system: Corrective; password recovery, reset, lock out notifications
- •	Antivirus (AV) software: Corrective; detect and quarantine known threats


<h3>Findings (should be addressed, but no immediate need)</h3>

Controls that should be implemented:

- •	Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention: Preventative/corrective; required for legacy systems to identify and mitigate potential threats, risks, and vulnerabilities
- •	Time-controlled safe: Deterrent; reduce attack surface/impact of physical threats
- •	Adequate lighting: Deterrent; limit “hiding” places to deter threats
- •	Closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance: Preventative/detective; can reduce risk of certain events; can be used after event for investigation
- •	Signage indicating alarm service provider: Deterrent; makes the likelihood of a successful attack seem low
- •	Fire detection and prevention (fire alarm, sprinkler system, etc.): Detective/Preventative; detect fire in the toy store’s physical location to prevent damage to inventory, servers, etc.


<h3>Summary/Recommendations</h3>

- To achieve the goals of Botium Toys, I would recommend the implementation of the controls listed in the critical findings, as soon as possible, to secure both digital and physical assets. Adherence with GDPR, PCI DSS, and System and Organization controls, by developing new policies, is a must.
While not necessary immediately, the rest of the findings should be addressed to further improve Botium Toys’ security posture.
